This repository contains information about my practical engineering experiences in University so far. 
The scope includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Robot Design

Electronic Circuits & Integrated Circuits - using PSpice & Cadence
Signals and Systems - using MATLAB

Investigating Wireless Communication channels - using MATLAB

Statistics - using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Assembly Language - using DrMIPs software

FPGA Design - using Vivado by AMD (based in VHDL)


The above is a brief outline.
