This project was to build a path-following robot that operates on a provided path. The path is outlined by white track on a black background board. 


Infra-red (IR) sensors
H-bridge IC (HD74HC14P)
DC linear voltage regulator IC (LM7805) 
Motor Driver IC (L293D)
Arduino Nano - Microcontroller (MCU)

Throughout the months that preceded the project assignment, I learnt to use a digital signal oscilloscope, multimeter and power supply. The project made use of breadboards and jumper wires. 

Below are some project implementation photographs.

The robot working principle is described briefly below:

Infrared sensors using LED's were used to detect the path at a frequency of 1kHz. When the path changed, the ON/OFF status of the indicator LED on the infrared sensors changed accordingly. 
This was used to adjust the rotation directions of motors attached to the left & right wheel, as well as speed of the individual motors. This allows for directional control & speed control. 


Takeaways:
Apart from the practical exposure to essential electronic engineering equipment, this course introduced the engineering design process.
